### Description

 This application is intended to allow users to interact with information extracted from a MAMP SQL server powered by Apache, through JDBC. Users will be able to search for films by their ID, by patterns and keywords, and they will be able to edit/delete those films. Users will also be able to create films, adding them to the database.

 ### Implemented Topics and Technologies

 * SpringBoot
 * Gradle Build Automation Tool
 * JDBC
 * MVC
 * MAMP
 * SQL
 * Apache Powered Servers
 * MySQL Drivers
 * SQL Queries
 * Predicates and Functions
 * Object-relational Mapping

 ### Run Instructions

 * Open the project on the Java supported IDE of your choosing
 * Run the application on a server of your choosing
 * Choose whether you'd like to search for a film by its ID, create a film, or search for a film by a keyword or pattern. After typing in the required information, you will be able to choose whether you'd like to delete the film, update the film, or return to the home page.

 ### Lessons Learned

 * It is good practice to limit user input to correlate with database limitations
